Padyakke RC1 Known problems

Latin glyphs are not kerned. This includes latin punctuation mark + kannada letter pairs. These will be kerned after the final release of BioRhyme. 

TTFA creates a visible break in the intersection in the ma subscript glyphs (At least on Windows 7 it does). I will notify the TTFA devs. 

If exported directly from Glyphs there will be problems with the GDEF table that will break kerning in some software.

To fix this:
- Export the font
- Go to your glyphs temporary directory
- Manually remove everything after the DIST feature
- Run generateFont.command. This will generate an OpenType font without the broken GDEF table.
- Youâ€™ll have to convert the working OpenType fonts to TTF with another tool.
