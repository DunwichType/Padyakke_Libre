# Padyakke Libre

Padyakke is a typeface developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders. 

Dunwich Type Founders cares what you think! Please file issues on the Github project issue tracker, at https://github.com/DunwichType/RhodiumLibre/issues or contact us privately at padyakkefonts@gmail.com

Padyakke is a Kannada typeface intended to pair with BioRhyme by Aoife Mooney (https://github.com/aoifemooney/makingbiorhyme). The extra light extended face currently being developed is intended for use in presentations. 

At present there is no historical model for Padyakke as I am not aware of any extra light or extended Kannada typeface. If you know of any please let me know! Shapes and proportions of Padyakke are based on Adobe Kannada and Noto Kannada.

Padyakke was developed and compiled using Glyphs 2 by Georg Seifert available from http://www.glyphsapp.com and proofs are created with Adobe Indesign CC 2014.
