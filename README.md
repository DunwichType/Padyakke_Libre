# Padyakke Libre

• About Padyakke 
Padyakke is a wide, airy, and friendly font for the Kannada writing system.  Its gracefully balanced thin strokes rise up over sumptuously swollen bottoms. Padyakke was designed to pair with Aoife Mooney’s latin typeface BioRhyme; thus BioRhyme’s idosyncratic bowls, not-quite-perpendicular stroke terminals, and teardrop terminals are also in Padyakke.

Official source files and compiled fonts are released at: https://github.com/DunwichType/Padyakke_Libre

The TrueType Padyakke font is manually hinted. It was hinted with Glyphs and hints are in the source file (Padyakke.glyphs). 

Latin glyphs were taken directly from version 36 of BioRhyme. They will probably be replaced with the final versions of the BioRhyme glyphs after it is released. There is currently no kerning for the latin glyphs; it will be added after BioRhyme is completed.

Source files for Kannada PDF proofs are in the Dunwich Type proofs repository: https://github.com/DunwichType/DTF_Proofs
