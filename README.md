# Padyakke Libre

Padyakke is a typeface developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders. Padyakke is a Kannada typeface intended to pair with BioRhyme by Aoife Mooney (https://github.com/aoifemooney/makingbiorhyme). The extra light extended font currently being developed is intended for use in presentations. 

Padyakke contains data from BioRhyme by Aoife Mooney. BioRhyme can be found at: https://github.com/aoifemooney/makingbiorhyme

Padyakke contains data from Hind Mysuru by Indian Type Foundry. Hind Mysuru can be found at: https://github.com/itfoundry/hind-mysuru

Dunwich Type Founders cares what you think! Please file issues on the Github project issue tracker, at https://github.com/DunwichType/Padyakke_Libre/issues or contact us privately at padyakkefonts@gmail.com.

At present there is no historical model for Padyakke as I am not aware of any extra light or extended Kannada typeface. If you know of any please let me know! Shapes and proportions of Padyakke are based on Adobe Kannada and Noto Kannada.

Source files for the PDF proofs are in the Dunwich Type proofs repository: https://github.com/DunwichType/DTF_Proofs

Padyakke was developed with Glyphs 2 available from http://www.glyphsapp.com.
